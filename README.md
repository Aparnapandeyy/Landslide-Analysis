# Landslide-Analysis
This paper discusses a landslide data analysis project aimed at predicting compound disaster events using machine learning. Compound disasters, such as those triggered by heavy rain, floods, or storms, can cause severe damage, and predicting such events can aid in disaster management. The model uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
